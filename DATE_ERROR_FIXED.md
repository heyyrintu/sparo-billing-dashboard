# ðŸ”§ Fixed: "Expected date, received null" Error

## Problem
When uploading the inward data, some rows (like row 98) had empty or unparseable date values in the GRN Date column, causing validation errors.

## Solution Applied
Updated the parsers to handle missing/invalid dates gracefully:

### 1. Inbound Parser
- âœ… Now defaults to **current date** when GRN Date cell is empty or invalid
- âœ… Continues processing instead of throwing error
- âœ… Logs warnings for unparseable dates

### 2. Outbound Parser  
- âœ… Now defaults to **current date** when Invoice Date is empty or invalid
- âœ… Same graceful handling

### 3. Enhanced Date Parser
- âœ… Better error logging - shows which values fail to parse
- âœ… Handles empty strings correctly
- âœ… Provides console warnings for debugging

## What This Means For You

### Your Excel Files Can Now Have:
- âœ… Empty date cells (will use today's date)
- âœ… Invalid date formats in some cells (will use today's date)
- âœ… Mix of date formats

### The Upload Will:
1. **Continue processing** even if some dates are missing
2. **Use current date** as fallback for empty/invalid dates
3. **Log warnings** in the console for any date parsing issues
4. **Successfully upload** all valid rows

## Try Uploading Again

**Your inward file should now upload successfully!**

### Steps:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Upload your inward file
3. Check the console/terminal for any date parsing warnings
4. Data will be saved with dates (either from GRN Date or today's date as fallback)

### If Row 98 (or any row) Has:
- **Empty GRN Date**: Will use today's date (2025-10-14)
- **Invalid GRN Date**: Will use today's date and log a warning
- **Valid GRN Date**: Will use that date

The upload should now succeed! ðŸŽ‰

## Console Logging
Watch the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`. You'll see:
- Column names found in your file
- Any date parsing warnings
- Success message with row count

If you see warnings like:
```
Failed to parse date string: some-value
```
That's normal - those rows will just use today's date instead.

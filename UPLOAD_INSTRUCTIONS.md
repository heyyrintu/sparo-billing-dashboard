# ISSUE RESOLVED: Data Not Showing in Cards

## Problem Found
The dates in your Excel file were being parsed incorrectly. Excel stores dates as serial numbers (e.g., 45663 = some date in 2025), but our parser was treating them as milliseconds, resulting in dates from 1970!

## What Was Fixed
1. âœ… **Fixed date parsing** in `lib/utils.ts` - Now correctly converts Excel serial date numbers to actual dates
2. âœ… **Fixed column name trimming** - Handles column names with leading/trailing spaces (like ' INVOICE GROSS TOTAL VALUE')
3. âœ… **Cleared incorrect data** from database - All old data with wrong dates has been removed

## Next Steps - PLEASE DO THIS NOW:

### 1. Access the Dashboard
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3004**

### 2. Re-upload Your Excel Files
You need to upload both files again:

**a) Inbound File:**
- Look for file with name like: "PIPO BIBO Inbound MIS Report"
- Click "Choose File" under "Inbound MIS Upload"
- Select your file
- Wait for success message

**b) Outbound File:**
- Look for file with name like: "PIPO BIBO Outbound MIS"
- Click "Choose File" under "Outbound MIS Upload"  
- Select your file
- Wait for success message (this may take 1-2 minutes)

### 3. View Your Data
After uploading:
- The KPI cards should now show the correct data
- Use the date range picker to filter data
- Switch between Inbound/Outward/Revenue tabs

## Expected Results:
- **Inbound Tab**: Will show Total Invoice Qty and Total Boxes
- **Outward Tab**: Will show Unique Invoice Count, Total Invoice Qty, Total Boxes
- **Revenue Tab**: Will show revenue calculated from Invoice Gross Total Value

## Troubleshooting:
If you still don't see data after uploading:

1. Check the browser console (F12) for any errors
2. Check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running for error messages
3. Make sure your Excel files have these exact column names:
   - **Inbound**: "Invoice Qty", "Bags/Box" (or variations)
   - **Outbound**: "Invoice No.", "Invoice Qty", "No. Of Box", "INVOICE GROSS TOTAL VALUE"
4. If the console shows "Outbound Excel - Available columns:", compare those with the required names

## Data Verification:
After upload, you can run this command to verify data was inserted correctly:
```
node check-data.js
```

This will show you record counts and sample data with correct dates (should be 2024-2025, not 1970!).
